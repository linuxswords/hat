# HAT - Handicap Archery Tournament

A website that serves tournament handling for archery with a handicap system.

The handicap system is a normalizing function that equalized bow classes, as longbow, historical, compound etc, by taking the past champion ship results and calculating the normalizing factor with the historical bow class as the base.



The sceleton setup has been generated by the following prompt:

`create a golang project called HAT. It should host a website to handle archery tournaments. The user should be able to enter participants, their bow class. On another page he should be able to add the tournament score, possibly multiple scores. It must be able to produce a tournament result list where the score is calculated. The calculation is a normalizing function that takes the tournament score and a factor which is bound to the bow class of the participants. This is a handicap system. The admin user should be able to enter multiple sets of handicap data`
